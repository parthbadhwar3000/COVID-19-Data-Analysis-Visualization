# COVID-19-Data-Analysis-Visualization

• Designed and implemented a MySQL database to store and analyse COVID-19 data from
large datasets (~1M+ records).

• Performed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations to clean, preprocess, and
standardize data for analysis.

• Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends in confirmed cases,
fatalities, and recovery rates.

• Wrote optimized SQL queries to compute country-wise mortality rates, active cases, and
top affected regions.

• Developed data visualizations (bar charts, heatmaps, choropleth maps) to analyse global
COVID-19 trends.

• Investigated correlations between population size and infection rates, detecting
anomalies in reported data.
